**When I run ccminer, I get an `invalid device symbol` error.**

GPU dev said the card does not support the features required in ccminer. This is not specific to HTMLCOIN version, this will occur in tpruvot's ccminer as well. Workaround is to use bfgminer and hash using OpenCL drivers.

**Can I mine with CPU?**

Unfortunately, the network difficulty is so high, CPU mining is a wasteful. If you want to CPU mine, choose an altcoin that is still CPU friendly such as [Cryptonote](https://www.cryptunit.com/?order=price24).
